                    <h1>Distance Running</h2>
                    <p>I first began to get into distance running in the spring of 2015. I found it very difficult early on, as I had problems with motivation and foot pain. Over time, the motivation came natually, and I was able to find great resources to assist me with purchasing the correct footware. In the intervening months between now and when I first started, I've complated close to 2o half marathons and one full marathon. I am slated to run another marathon in April of 2017, and I intend to eventually train and complete an ultra marathon</p>

                    <h2>Reading</h2>
                    <p>Ever since I was a child I have been a fan of reading. I distinctly remember getting lost in all of the fiction work we were required to read in middle and high school. I often read in secret as my friends would often tease me for my affection towards reading! These days, I primarily read nonfiction work, particular topics related to real world applications, such as business, psychology, and economics. Every now and again, i'll dive head first into a work of fiction. My favorites in the fiction realm deal primarily with science fiction, as I am infatuated with the idea of life and experiences that are currently unattainable for both myself and mankind</p>

                    <h2>Socializing with my friends</h2>
                    <p>My close friends mean everything to me, and I hold some members of my friend group as close as I hold my family. I wouldn't be the man I am today without them, and I hope that they feel the same towards me. Those I spend most of my time with these days I met back in college, through mutual friends and roommates. Oddly enough, the closest friends I have today were found through Craiglist! There's a long story behind that, and I wont get into it here, but I am very fortunate to have the friends that I have today</p>
